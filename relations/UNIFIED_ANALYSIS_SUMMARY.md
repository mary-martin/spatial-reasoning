# Unified Uniqueness Analysis Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the unified approach that combines 1-edge and 2-edge uniqueness analysis methods to provide a comprehensive view of uniqueness in CLEVR scenes. This approach reveals more sophisticated patterns than either method alone.

## The Unified Approach

### Combining 1-Edge and 2-Edge Methods

The unified analysis combines two complementary uniqueness detection methods:

1. **1-Edge Uniqueness**: Object-specific patterns where individual objects have unique incoming or outgoing relations
2. **2-Edge Uniqueness**: Path-specific patterns where objects have unique incoming 2-edge path combinations

### Key Benefits of the Unified Approach

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Captures both direct and multi-step spatial relationships
- **Object Classification**: Identifies objects with different types of uniqueness
- **Educational Value**: Enables more sophisticated spatial reasoning tasks
- **Pattern Discovery**: Reveals objects that have both types of uniqueness
